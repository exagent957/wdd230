          PHS marching band takes top places <br />
          - Herald Journal 10/13/2021
        </h3>
        <p>
          It was a cold wet morning as the Preston High School marching band
          boarded the bus to attend the Bridgeland Band Invitational at USU’s
          Maverik Stadium in Logan on Oct. 9. <br />
          <br />
          The Indians were the first to perform at 8:45 a.m. and the rain
          continued to pour down throughout their routine. <br />
          <br />
          Their long hours of practice and hard work paid off with a third place
          overall finish in their division. Percussion placed second, and music
          ensemble placed first. <br />
          <br />
          Of 43 schools, nine from Idaho, from 3A to 6A in size, Preston was
          34th, ranking higher than Century, Madison and other Idaho schools.
          The rain let up during the 1:30 p.m. 3A and 5A awards ceremony and
          more spectators filled the stands. <br />
          <br />
          “I’m happy with our performance, but our percussion was half a point
          off from taking first, and our band was four points off from taking
          first place in our division,” said drum major Luis Herring who
          choreographed the routine. “These are small things in practice that we
          can improve on, that we should improve on. So, I am confident that we
          will definitely do better this next week.” <br />
          <br />
          Preston performs at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 16, at Highland High
          school in Pocatello at the Mountain West Invitational. <br />
