        <h2>Welcome Message from Hartselle Mayor Randy Garrison</h2>
        <p>
          On behalf of the City of Hartselle I welcome your interest in our
          hometown. Founded in 1870 Hartselle has a long history and proud
          traditions. We are currently working to improve the lives of each of
          our citizens by bringing new business and industry to our city. We are
          also making plans so the next generation of those who will call
          Hartselle home are able to be blessed with the life and happiness that
          those who came before them enjoyed as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Affectionately known as “The City of Southern Hospitality” we seek to
          share this with those who live here, as well as those who visit our
          fair city. From families who claim several generations of those who
          have called Hartselle home, up to those who have recently made the
          move to Hartselle, you are soon to find the friendliness of a small
          community, but one that also offers many opportunities and facilities
          usually found in larger cites. All one needs to do is walk down the
          sidewalks of our downtown to find a friendly smile and maybe even a
          “how are y’all doing” greeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hartselle offers a highly rated school system, park and recreation
          facilities for many sports, an outstanding aquatic center, arts
          center, historical and contemporary housing, large number of churches
          for the faith based community, unique dining facilities and a safe
          place for raising your family. Hartselle is ideal for those looking
          for a small town lifestyle, but is also located conveniently to larger
          cities for other services. Whether you are coming to visit or planning
          to call Hartselle home, we welcome you and know you will find your
          place here among friends.

          First Christian Church in Hartselle, 209 E. Main St., presents a live
          nativity scene in front of the church. The annual event features live
          animals as well as members of the church dressed as Bible characters.
          The scene will be staged nightly Dec. 8-23 from 6-7:30 p.m. The public
          is invited to drive by or walk up to view and pet the animals. This
          will be the fourth year for the event, which organizers said is
          designed to draw attention to the true meaning of the season.
