        and using the site of which the site content can provide the answers
        such as Does that store carry a polo shirt in my size? What color
        options exist? Price? How do I make a CSS-driven drop-down navigation
        bar? I need to transfer funds from one account to another at my bank.
        Who won the game last night? What was the score? What's the weather
        going to be this weekend at the trail I'm planning to hike?.... example

        motivation (reason people will come to site). Personas. Scenarios - list
