        <h3>Some homeowners wary of proposed Bear Lake development</h3>
        <p>
          ST. CHARLES, Idaho – A proposed development could more than double the
          population of St. Charles on the Idaho side of Bear Lake. Some area
          homeowners are trying to fight it but there may not be much they can
          do. <br />
          <br />
          That’s frustrating to Wayne Keetch. His family homesteaded in St.
          Charles. “I was born and raised here,” he explained. He came back to
          the area in the early ’70s. “This house was the newest house in St.
          Charles for five years.” The longtime cattle rancher said the area
          hasn’t seen a whole lot of growth, until recently. “A year ago, there
          were eight new homes built right here in St. Charles so we’ve seen a
          lot of growth in the last few years,” he said. They could soon see a
          whole lot more. <br />
          <br />
          “I think we’ve checked every box,” said developer Thom Morgan. “I
          think we’ve gone through every item.” He recently told a packed room
          before the Bear Lake County Planning and Zoning commission that his
          team has spent four and a half years making sure they do this right.
          The Seven Mile Ranch Subdivision just outside of St. Charles would
          have one home per acre and some very strict HOA rules to limit
          short-term rentals from getting out of hand.<br />
          <br />
          Resident Stacey Transtrum wasn’t so sure. “What used to be holiday
          weekends, we’re seeing that influx of people on every weekend, not
          just the holidays.”As the popularity of Bear Lake grows, interest in
          summer homes is going up with it. Keetch said he understands that but
          worries about what’s happening to his small town. “I’m trying to be
          open-minded about the whole thing, but all of a sudden to have
          several, well 250 new homes in the area is not exactly my idea of
          fun,” he said. <br />
          <br />
          As long as the developers are able to keep up with building and zoning
          requirements these plans will likely continue to go forward. The first
          two phases were passed on to the county commission for review. Some
          say the area could use the boost in tax revenue. “At full buildout,
          that’s going to have a significant impact on the asset value of Bear
          Lake County, and cash flow that will add to the varying taxing
          districts that this property resides with,” homeowner Roy Bunderson
          said. Morgan said he’s made sure there will be enough well water for
          the homes and he will work with the community to try and keep traffic
          on U.S. Highway 89 and off city roads. <br />
